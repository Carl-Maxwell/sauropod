# Sauropod

A version of the Hazel Engine by the Cherno, I'm writing it by following the tutorial video series ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT&index=1 )

The actual hazel engine repo is: https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel/

I decided to call this version Sauropod instead of calling it Hazel.
